# GNU make

GNU make 4.4.1 builds through the shared configure/make helper. Python-owned cross configure answers and pinned WASI patches select the virtual process facade. The resulting executable runs inside Shellsim, using its process and filesystem boundaries.

`recipe.json` owns source pins, exact graph dependencies, exports and checks.
`build.py` exposes the typed `build(ctx)` entrypoint and package-specific options.

```sh
uv run --no-project --python /path/to/installed-shellsim/bin/python \
  python -m ports native/make --store /path/to/ports-store \
  --output /path/to/release --check
```

See the [ports authoring guide](../../README.md) for SDK materialization,
retained workspaces and cache admission. Historical sealed artifact receipts retain
their original identities; obsolete production build CLIs are retired.
