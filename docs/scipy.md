# SciPy in shellsim

shellsim ships `scipy.special` for simulated Python programs. It targets the observable behavior
of SciPy 1.18.1 with NumPy 2.5.3: values, result dtypes, error types and messages, and warnings.
It never runs host SciPy. The other SciPy subpackages raise `NotImplementedError` when imported.

## Architecture

- **Ufuncs.** Each `scipy.special` function is an entry in NumPy's ufunc table (see
  [numpy.md](numpy.md)), so broadcasting, `out=`, `where=`, `dtype=`, casting and scalar results
  behave as they do for NumPy's ufuncs. The native module `_scipy_special` exports them.
- **Kernels** (`src/python/stdlib/scipy/special/`). The kernels are ports of the code SciPy 1.18
  runs. Most functions come from Cephes, through SciPy's xsf library. The incomplete beta
  function, its inverse, and the Student's t and F distributions come from Boost.Math.
  `NOTICE.md` lists the ported components and reproduces their licenses.
- **Frozen Python** (`src/python/stdlib/source/scipy/`). `scipy.special` star-imports the
  native module and adds the functions SciPy writes in Python: `zeta`, `comb`, `perm`,
  `factorial`, `logsumexp`, `softmax` and `log_softmax`. They follow SciPy's code, so their
  argument handling and messages match. The `scipy` package loads subpackages on first access,
  as SciPy does.

### Loop selection

SciPy registers a `float32` loop and a `float64` loop for each function, and NumPy selects the
first loop that every input casts to safely. `float32`, `float16` and 8- and 16-bit integer
inputs therefore compute in single precision. Wider integers and `float64` compute in double
precision. `logit` registers its `float64` loop first, so only `float32` input selects single
precision. `expit`, `logit`, `log_expit`, `xlogy` and `xlog1py` round every step to single
precision, as xsf's templates do. The other single-precision loops compute in `f64` and round
the result, as SciPy's do.

`bdtr` and `bdtrc` also have a loop that takes the trial count `n` as an integer. When a call
selects a loop with a floating-point `n`, it issues SciPy's `DeprecationWarning`.

As in SciPy, the kernels never raise floating-point errors, and `np.errstate` does not affect
them. Domain errors return NaN and poles return infinities.

## Supported surface

- **Error function.** `erf`, `erfc`, `erfinv`, `erfcinv`, `ndtr`, `log_ndtr`, `ndtri`.
- **Gamma and beta.** `gamma`, `rgamma`, `gammaln`, `loggamma`, `psi` (and `digamma`), `beta`,
  `betaln`, `poch`, `binom`, `zeta`.
- **Incomplete gamma and beta.** `gammainc`, `gammaincc`, `gammaincinv`, `gammainccinv`,
  `betainc`, `betaincc`, `betaincinv`.
- **Distributions.** `stdtr`, `stdtrit`, `chdtr`, `chdtrc`, `chdtri`, `fdtr`, `fdtrc`, `fdtri`,
  `pdtr`, `pdtrc`, `bdtr`, `bdtrc`.
- **Logistic and information theory.** `expit`, `logit`, `log_expit`, `xlogy`, `xlog1py`,
  `entr`, `rel_entr`, `kl_div`.
- **Other.** `boxcox`, `inv_boxcox`, `comb`, `perm`, `factorial`, `logsumexp`, `softmax`,
  `log_softmax`.

## Compatibility contract

The portable suites in `tests/python/scipy/` are the contract. Their literal expectations were
checked against the SciPy and NumPy versions pinned in `tests/python/scientific-requirements.txt`.
Cargo runs them under shellsim's pytest alongside the NumPy suites; see
[numpy.md](numpy.md#compatibility-contract) for re-checking them against real SciPy.
`tests/python/scipy.rs` holds shellsim-only checks for the unsupported frontier and resource
limits.

## Deliberate differences

- **`bdtr` and `bdtrc` warnings.** SciPy warns once for each element with a floating-point `n`;
  shellsim warns once per call. Under the default filters, both show a single warning.
- **`bdtr` and `bdtrc` precision.** shellsim evaluates both through Boost's incomplete beta
  function, where SciPy uses Cephes' `incbet`. The results agree less closely as `n` grows; at
  `n = 1000` their relative difference reaches about `7e-13`.

## Unsupported frontier

These fail explicitly with shellsim's unsupported-operation error or `NotImplementedError`:

- complex input to functions that have complex loops in SciPy, such as `erf`, `gamma`,
  `loggamma`, `psi`, `xlogy` and `zeta`. Functions without complex loops raise SciPy's
  `TypeError`;
- `reduce` and `accumulate` of `scipy.special` ufuncs;
- `factorial(..., extend="complex")`;
- importing any subpackage other than `scipy.special`.

Other `scipy.special` functions are absent, so accessing them raises `AttributeError`.

## Safety and accounting

Every element is charged a flat CPU cost. Series, continued fractions and root finders can need
from a few to millions of iterations, depending on the arguments. The Hurwitz zeta sum for a
negative non-integer `q`, for example, runs about `|q|` terms, as SciPy's does. So the kernels
also count their iterations, and each element is charged for the iterations it ran.

An element runs under an allowance of iterations. If it exhausts the allowance, shellsim charges
the work done and evaluates the element again with twice the allowance. Work per element is
therefore bounded by the CPU limit rather than by a fixed cap. Kernels are pure functions, so a
repeated evaluation gives the same result, and the repeated work is at most the work of the
final evaluation.
